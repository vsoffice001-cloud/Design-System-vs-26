## 🚀 HOW IT WORKS (THE MAGIC)

### BEFORE (Manual Rules):
```
You: "Build a hero section"
AI: *creates section with random typography*
You: "No, use var(--text-3xl) for h1, not text-4xl"
AI: *fixes*
You: "And the button should be size=\"md\" not size=\"lg\""
AI: *fixes*
You: "And keep shimmer active"
... endless corrections ...
```

### AFTER (Automatic Rules):
```
You: [Paste AI SYSTEM PROMPT from AI_CONTEXT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md]
AI: "Design system loaded ✅"

You: "Build a hero section"
AI: *creates section with:*
    - h1 using var(--text-3xl) ✅
    - Button size="md" ✅
    - Shimmer active ✅
    - Correct spacing ✅
    - Proper colors ✅
... perfect on first try! ✨
```
